        <p>
          The four permanent adult teeth, known as wisdom teeth, are placed at
          the top and bottom back corners of your mouth. A wisdom tooth
          extraction is a surgical procedure to remove one or more of these
          teeth. You'll need to have a wisdom tooth extracted if it is impacted
          or causing you pain, an infection, or other dental issues. An oral
          surgeon or a dentist can remove a wisdom tooth. Even if impacted teeth
          aren't causing issues, some dentists and oral surgeons advise wisdom
          tooth extraction to avoid future problems.

        <p>
          When wisdom teeth grow in and erupt, they may crowd your teeth and
          harm other molars. Wisdom teeth can eventually cause alignment
          problems if there isn't enough room for them because other teeth are
          gradually pushed out of the way. As a result, getting your wisdom
          teeth out reduces the possibility of requiring braces or different
          pricey types of corrective surgery to fix your teeth' alignment.
          Having your wisdom teeth removed minimizes the possibility of your
          carefully crafted smile being undone, especially if you've already
          undergone braces or oral surgery for correction.
