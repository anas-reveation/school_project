      <h5 class="mb-3">
        Here are 5 reasons why dental implants are most popular today:
      </h5>
      <h6>1- Helps Improve Your Facial Aesthetics</h6>
      <p>
        One of the biggest advantages of dental implants is they help preserve
        the jaw bone and prevent it from further deterioration. This helps
        restore your facial structure, enhancing overall facial aesthetics. When
        all or most of your natural teeth are missing or severely damaged, it
        impedes natural bone growth in the jaws. This causes your facial
        structure to deteriorate over time and the results are disheartening –
        the lower jaw shrivels in, lips fold in, and “marionette lines”
        (wrinkles) appear around the mouth. This can significantly affect your
        smile and self-esteem. A permanent and effective solution like dental
        implantology functions as natural jaw bone to hold your artificial teeth
        in place. This prevents the facial structure from collapsing and
        enhances your overall appearance.
      </p>
      <h6>2- Reliable and Long-lasting</h6>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional restorations like dental bridges, crowns or veneers,
        dental implants provide effective and long-lasting results. Our
        experienced Implantologist dr ketul Patel use high-quality, imported
        implant systems that ensure long-term warranty. We use advanced
        computer-guided dental implant surgery to provide reliable and
        affordable dental treatment solutions.
      </p>
      <h6>3- Get Immediate Results</h6>
      <p>

        effective results. However, each dental implant case is unique and we
        can provide a more accurate treatment timeframe based by assessing the
        patient’s dental condition.
      </p>
      <h6>4- Better Chewing and Speaking Ability</h6>
      <p>
        A dental implant is anchored in the jaw bone and functions as the root
        of your artificial tooth. In the long run, it helps preserve the
        integrity of your jaw bone and minimises bone resorption. Using dental
        implants to replace your lost teeth helps restore your facial structure,
        enabling you to speak clearly and chew your food better.
      </p>
      <h6>5- Affordable Dental Implant Cost in Ahmedabad</h6>
      <p>
        Dental implant is a proven and effective prosthetic solution for most
        kinds of dental problems. However, it involves high cost which can be a
        disappointment for many patients. But with vardan dental clinic®, you
        get affordable tooth implant cost in Ahmedabad without compromising with
        the quality and reliability of your treatment solution. Despite its
        cost, dental implants help improve overall oral health and provide

          After that, osseointegration occurs, a process that promotes bone
          healing around implants. The bone surrounding and supporting an
          implant makes it so robust.
