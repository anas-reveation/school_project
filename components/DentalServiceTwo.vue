      <p>
        When teeth are lost, your jaw's bone density also frequently decreases.
        To keep its mass, the jawbone requires stimulation, which it receives
        when your teeth erupt. The only tooth replacement method that also
        restores the stimulation of the jaw bone, such as dental implants, aids
        in preventing bone loss. Dental implants are available in a massive
        range of sizes and forms. Your dentist will collaborate with you to
        create custom implants that fill the gap and match the colour of your
        neighbouring teeth. The only people who will know which teeth are
        implants are you and your dentist.
