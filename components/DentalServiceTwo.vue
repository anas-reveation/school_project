      <h5 class="mb-3">Here are 5 reasons why dental implants are most popular today:</h5>
      <h6> 1- Helps Improve Your Facial Aesthetics</h6>
      <p>One of the biggest advantages of dental implants is they help preserve the jaw bone and prevent it from further deterioration. This helps restore your facial structure, enhancing overall facial aesthetics.
When all or most of your natural teeth are missing or severely damaged, it impedes natural bone growth in the jaws. This causes your facial structure to deteriorate over time and the results are disheartening – the lower jaw shrivels in, lips fold in, and “marionette lines” (wrinkles) appear around the mouth. This can significantly affect your smile and self-esteem.
A permanent and effective solution like dental implantology functions as natural jaw bone to hold your artificial teeth in place. This prevents the facial structure from collapsing and enhances your overall appearance.
</p>
<h6> 2- Reliable and Long-lasting</h6>
      <p>Unlike traditional restorations like dental bridges, crowns or veneers, dental implants provide effective and long-lasting results.

          After that, osseointegration occurs, a process that promotes bone
          healing around implants. The bone surrounding and supporting an
          implant makes it so robust.
