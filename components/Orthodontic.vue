        <p>
          Orthodontic treatment aims to straighten or move teeth to enhance
          their function and appearance. Spreading the pressure of biting over
          all of your teeth can also protect the long-term health of your teeth,
          gums, and jaw joints. The teeth will be straightened or moved into a
          better place with orthodontic therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to making them easier to clean, this can enhance their
          appearance and the way their teeth bite together. Some people have
          ugly, protruding upper front teeth. The likelihood of damage to these
          "prominent" teeth is higher, but orthodontic therapy can realign them.
          The way the upper and lower jaws come together can make teeth appear
          ugly and result in a bad bite. Both of these issues might be resolved
          with orthodontic treatment.

        <p>
          Orthodontic therapy can enhance your facial features, improve your
          dental health, and increase your self-esteem. It might give you a
          chance to take part in enhancing your appearance. Even before their
          treatments are over, patients frequently report feeling more assured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both your appearance and dental health can be improved with
          orthodontic therapy. Cleaning and maintaining teeth that are straight
          and in alignment is simpler. Orthodontic issues can be fixed to help
          stop tooth decay, gum disease, and even tooth loss.
