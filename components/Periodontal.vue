        <h4 class="service-t fw-semibold">What is Periodontal Flap Surgery?</h4>
        <p>
          Flap surgery is frequently carried out under local anaesthetic,
          perhaps with the help of oral sedatives; it can also be done under
          intravenous conscious sedation. A minor incision is performed to
          detach the gums from the teeth after the anaesthetic has taken effect.
          The outer gum tissue is gently folded aside to access the roots and
          the supporting ligament and bone tissue. In this typical treatment,
          doctors make a few tiny incisions in your gums and remove a piece of
          tissue back. Then, they clean the bacteria and tartar off your teeth
          and the area around your gums. The gums are sutured back to ensure
          that the tissue fits snugly around your teeth. Cleaning particular
          parts of your teeth and gums will be simpler once you have recovered.

          Benifits of Periodontal Flap Surgery
        </h4>
        <p>
          Your smile will look better since the operation can help your gum
          tissue to reattach to your roots and lessen the depth and appearance
          of gum pockets by eliminating plaque and tartar that have built up
          below your gum line. Reduce the likelihood of developing a significant
          illness: Heart disease, cancer, and other systemic diseases like
          cancer and respiratory disease have all been associated with gum
          disease. Professional treatment for gum disease can lower your risk of
          contracting these illnesses and improve your general health.
