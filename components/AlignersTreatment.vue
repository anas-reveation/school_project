          Key Benefits With Clear Aligner Therapy
        </h4>
        <p>
          Clear aligners not only offer the end benefits of traditional
          orthodontic treatment without using wires and braces, such as straight
          teeth and improved bite function but also offers unique benefits
          during treatment of its being TOTALLY WIRELESS (in the age of wifi)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Clear:</b> No brackets and wires. No need to hide your smile. The
          aligners are so clear that they go unnoticed while you are wearing
          them as the treatment continues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Comfortable:</b> Clear aligners are comfortable to wear and easy to
          maintain than braces, and even painless

          drink, brush and floss with complete freedom. At Vardan Dental, we
          bring you a customized set of aligners consisting of a series of
          thermoplastic trays that need to be worn for 20 to 22 hours each day
          for 7 to 10 days each.
