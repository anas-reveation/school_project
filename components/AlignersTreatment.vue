        <p>
          As an alternative to traditional braces, clear aligners are made to
          assist in moving teeth into the right position. Clear aligners, which
          lack metal wires and brackets but employ a progressive force to
          control tooth movement, are similar to braces. The aligners are
          designed to fit each person's mouth out of sturdy plastic. If a series
          of aligners is required, the teeth are moved incrementally with each
          aligner until the necessary movement is accomplished.

        <p>
          For alignment devices to work as effectively as possible, wearers must
          wear them for at least 20 hours daily. Before moving on to the
          subsequent aligner, each one is worn for three weeks. The severity of
          each condition determines how long each person has to wear aligners
          for treatment.

        <p>
          Clear aligners are a fantastic alternative for people who desire a
          straighter smile but do not want to wear traditional metal braces.
          Additionally, individuals who have had orthodontic treatment in the
          past and want to make small changes to their smile can benefit from
          aligners. Clear Aligners will improve your oral well-being and health
          once your teeth are straight. This is so that you can brush and floss
          your teeth more easily if they are straight. This is because you'll be
          able to clean all of your teeth's surfaces of plaque and food debris.
