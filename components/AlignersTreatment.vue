        <p>
          Clear Aligner therapy is an orthodontic treatment that uses a series
          of clear removable thermoplastic trays to gradually move your teeth to
          improve bite function and aesthetic appearance without using wires or
          braces.

          The Most Important Advantages of Clear Aligner Treatment
        </h4>
        <p>
          Clear aligners not only provide the results of traditional orthodontic
          treatment without the use of wires and braces, such as straight teeth
          and improved bite function, but they also provide the unique benefit
          of being WIRELESS during treatment (in the age of wifi)

        <ul class="row">
          <li class="col-md-12">
            There are no brackets or wires. There's no need to hide your smile.
            The aligners are so clear that they go unnoticed while you wear them
            throughout the treatment.
          </li>
          <li class="col-md-12">
            Clear aligners are more comfortable to wear and maintain than braces
            and are even painless.
