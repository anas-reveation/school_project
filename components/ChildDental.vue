        <p>
          Brushing and washing your child's teeth and gums daily is part of
          proper dental care. It also entails receiving essential treatments,
          such as fluoride, sealants, extractions, fillings, braces, and other
          orthodontics, as well as routine dental examinations.

          Baby teeth are important because they shape a child's bite and
          determine where the permanent teeth will erupt as the youngster grows.
          Because of this, young children can still benefit from orthodontics
          (braces), even though their baby or milk teeth should eventually fall
          out.

          When a baby drinks from a bottle, tooth decay can highlight the value
          of paediatric dental care. Bacteria on your baby's teeth from sugars
          in foods and drinks can cause damage to the enamel of milk teeth. This
          is why it's crucial to instil dental hygiene in your child from an
          early age, even if only through preventative measures.

          Sucking is a distinct newborn development stage that helps calm
          anxious kids. Since babies spend most of their first few months
          sucking on their mother's teat, when they are weaned from
          breastfeeding (or from bottle feeding), they will continue sucking.
