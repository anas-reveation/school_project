          Teeth whitening is a commonly performed cosmetic dentistry treatment
          that involves applications of a bleaching agent (hydrogen peroxide or
          carbamide peroxide) to whiten the teeth. Also commonly called tooth
          bleaching, the treatment specifically targets tooth discoloration by
          removing staining and reversing the effects of routine wear.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Although the best whitening results are most often achieved when
          performed by a dentist, there are a wide range of do-it-yourself teeth
          whitening options available (dentist prescribed and over the counter).
          Basic over-the-counter whitening options have the lowest concentration
          of peroxide, limiting their whitening strength.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The treatment procedure varies depending on the specific whitening
          option you select. In-office whitening generally takes one hour or
          less, during which a bleaching gel is applied to the surface of the
          teeth for one or more periods of 15 to 30 minutes. A high-intensity
          light may be used to help speed up the process. Patients will see
          whitened results immediately after treatment.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Although results are immediate, teeth whitening is not a permanent
          solution to discoloration. Dentists often prescribe take-home trays
          designed to maximize the effect and prolong results. In addition,
          certain foods and drinks should be avoided.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Dental veneers are tooth-colored shells of porcelain or composite
          placed over the top of the facial surfaces of the teeth to correct
          worn tooth enamel, uneven alignment or spacing issues, discoloration,
          chips or cracks. Veneer placement requires the permanent alteration —
          or “shaping” — of the host tooth/teeth. (Minimal preparation veneers
          offer an alternative to traditional veneers in that they require less
          preparation of the natural teeth; however they too are more invasive
          than whitening.)
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The veneer procedure varies from case to case, but is typically
          completed over a six week period and two dental visits — each of which
          can last several hours. The initial visit involves a diagnostic
          evaluation to ensure that there are no oral health concerns that may
          affect treatment, in addition to selecting veneer color from a shade
          chart. Some dentists use outside labs for veneer fabrication, while
          others use in-office CAD/CAM technology to fabricate onsite in a
          single visit. Depending on your dentist, temporary veneers may be used
          between visits.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          During the actual procedure appointment, a local anesthetic is
          administered to minimize discomfort. After placement your dentist will
          speak with you about how best to maximize the longevity of your
          veneers. This includes avoiding overly abrasive toothpastes and biting
          down on hard objects. If treated properly, veneers can last 15 years
          or longer before needing replaced.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="service-t fw-semibold">Are you a Candidate?</h4>
      <ul class="row">
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Teeth whitening is a minimally invasive procedure that does not have
          strict candidacy requirements. That said whitening isn’t right for
          everyone. Poor dental hygiene can inhibit whitening treatment. If you
          suffer from gum disease or tooth decay, you will first need to undergo
          corrective treatment before teeth whitening can be considered.
          Application of bleaching agents to unhealthy teeth could result in
          extreme pain. If you have deep tooth staining (intrinsic staining)
          affecting the underlying dentin layers, you may not be able to achieve
          the results you’re looking for with bleaching. Whitening cannot
          correct all discoloration issues (such as those associated with
          tetracycline). In such cases, additional smile makeover treatments
          such as veneers will likely be needed.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Dental veneer candidacy relies heavily on the health of the smile. If
          you have no underlying problems such as decay or gum disease, you
          stand a better chance of qualifying for veneer treatment. However, you
          might be surprised to hear your dentist advise against veneers; or at
          the very least suggest alternatives. Your dentist will always suggest
          the most conservative, minimally invasive option as a primary
          consideration. Oftentimes, people request veneers, even though they
          have an esthetically functional, attractive smile. If your issue is
          simply tooth discoloration, a dental veneer option may not be the best
          treatment for you. It requires the permanent alteration of your
          natural teeth, and can be considerably more expensive than whitening
          options that may suffice.
