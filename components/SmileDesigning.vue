          What is Smile Designing Treatment?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Smile Design Treatment is a cosmetic surgery that focuses on enhancing
          the look of your smile using specific techniques such as composite
          bonding, dental veneers, teeth whitening, and tooth implants. People
          with tooth decay, tooth sensitivity, discoloration, and bacterial
          plaque frequently choose this makeover procedure. This treatment
          considers several variables, such as lips, gum tissues, skin tone, and
          facial features.
        </p>

          Smile design is a cosmetic dentistry surgery that improves the
          appearance and health of your teeth by repairing minor flaws. It
          incorporates a tailored treatment and long-lasting results for a
          straighter, whiter, and more realistic-looking smile.
