        <p>
          A "root canal" is a component of a tooth, not a medical procedure. The
          pulp, commonly referred to as the hollow part of a tooth, is where the
          nerves, blood vessels, and other cells are located. The crown and
          roots make up a tooth. The roots are below the gum, whereas the crown
          is above it. The tooth is joined to the jawbone via the roots. The
          pulp is located inside the crown, root, or canal. The pulp hydrates
          the tissue around the tooth and feeds it nutrients. The pulp's nerves
          interpret heat and cold as painful.

          The term "root canal" actually refers to a dentistry procedure called
          endodontic therapy, which means "within the tooth." Even if the pulp
          is dead, the tooth's crown, the portion visible above the gums, can
          still be intact. The greatest technique to protect the tooth's
          structure is to remove damaged or infected pulp.
