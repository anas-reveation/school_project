          When a person needs RCT?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment (RCT) of a tooth is needed when the blood or nerve supply of the tooth (pulp) is irreversibly inflamed or infected because of decay (cavity), cracks, root infection, gums infection, traumatic occlusion or due to many other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Purpose of the root canal treatment is to remove the damaged/inflamed/infected pulp from the tooth and make sure that it is infection-sealed and the tooth is restored to its required function.
