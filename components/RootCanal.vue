          Best Root Canal Treatment Near Shahibaug, Ahemdabad
        </h4>
        <p>
          Root canal treatment is performed when the cavity is too deep, too
          close to a pulp, or the pulp is already infected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pulp tissue is completely removed up to the roots during this
          procedure, and the canals are cleaned with chemicals before being
          widened. The root canals are filled with resin cones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire procedure necessitates three to four visits. The tooth
          becomes brittle after root canal treatment because its blood supply is
          cut off.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of tooth is prone to fracture. The crown or cap is then
          placed on top.
