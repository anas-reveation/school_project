      <p>
        The primary cause of decay in the tooth cavity is frequently a pulp
        infection. The buildup of bacteria in this region causes infection of
        the pulp. The affected pulp is still harbouring these germs; if not
        treated, they could easily spread to nearby teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pulp that is infected must be removed during a root canal. Cleaning
        the afflicted area and fitting the tooth with a crown or filling the
        cavity with a polymer material are the next steps in the procedure.
