        What happens when a person requires RCT?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Root Canal Treatment (RCT) of a tooth is required when the tooth's blood
        or nerve supply (pulp) becomes irreversibly inflamed or infected due to
        decay (cavity), cracks, root infection, gum infection, traumatic
        occlusion, or a variety of other causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Root canal therapy aims to remove the damaged/inflamed/infected pulp
        from the tooth, seal it off from infection, and restore the tooth to its
        original function.

      <ul class="row">
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Pain when chewing or applying pressure to a tooth
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Pain when drinking cold or hot liquids</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Pain during the night or while lying down</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Continuous pain that may or may not is relieved by pain relievers
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Internal and external swelling</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Tooth crack or fracture</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Tooth discolouration or greying</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Large cavity with or without pain from food lodgement
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          There may be no pain or symptoms in the involved tooth.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In every case, the patient does not need to have symptoms; sometimes,
        pulpal tissues become infected so quickly that the patient does not have
        any symptoms, but this does not mean that the tooth is not inflamed or
        infectious. In short, "no pain in the tooth" does not imply "no problem
        in the tooth," as most people believe.
