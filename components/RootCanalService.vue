The patient doesn't need to have symptoms in every case; sometimes, pulpal tissues are infected so rapidly that patient may not have any symptoms, which doesn't mean that the tooth is not inflamed or infectious. In short, "No pain in tooth" doesn't mean "No problem in tooth", as majority of dental problems may not cause pain at all.

        The steps of Root Canal Treatment
      </h4>
      <p>
        Here, we at vardan dental clinic do the root canal treatment as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="row">
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The Specialist takes an pretreatment X-Ray of the tooth for confirmation of diagnosis.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">For complete pain relief and for comfortable experience during treatment, local anesthesia is given before starting procedure. Our vardan dental team in Ahmedabad, using specially developed techniques and newer anesthetics drugs, ensures that you will not feel pain or any discomfort while administering local anesthesia. Thus, with effective anesthesia and efficient expert hands, this procedure becomes completely painless.</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">After the tooth is anesthetized, root canal specialist uses a dental dam to fully isolate the tooth and maintain a sterile environment, increasing success rate of root canal treatment.</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Access Opening of Tooth – Cleaning of the decay portion and making access to pulp tissue or root canal of tooth using modern high-speed hand pieces like DENTSPLY SIRONA (USA). It exposes the root canal and the damaged nerve and immediately resolves the pain of the tooth.</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The root canal specialist measures length of all canals with J MORITA ROOT ZX II Apex Locator (a ROBOTIC digital equipment to judge the working length of root canal), which reduces requirements of multiple radiation exposures during treatment.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">BioMechanical Preparation of Root Canals – After measuring length, the Specialist cleans and reshapes the canal completely using NSK (UK) ENDOMATE DT (a ROBOTIC instrument for Root Canal Treatment), DENTSPLY PROTAPER ROTARY Flexi files with constant irrigation of canals with proper medicament. Achieving complete disinfection of root canals is the goal of this step.</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">Obturation – Once the tooth is made infection-free, the specialist obturates the canals with Gutta Percha filling material, seals the canals and take a final x-ray of confirmation.</li>
        <li class="col-md-12">The residual crown portion is reinforced with the light cure composites.
</li>
<li class="col-md-12">Once the root canal treatment is completed, in many cases, the specialist will plan a crown or onlay on the tooth for long term function, aesthetics and protection.
