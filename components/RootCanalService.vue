          There may not be any discomfort or symptoms in involved tooth The
          patient doesn't need to have symptoms in every case; sometimes, pulpal
          tissues are infected so rapidly that patient may not have any
          symptoms, which doesn't mean that the tooth is not inflamed or
          infectious. In short, "No pain in tooth" doesn't mean "No problem in
          tooth", as majority of dental problems may not cause pain at all.

      <h4 class="service-t fw-semibold">The steps of Root Canal Treatment</h4>
      <p>
        Here, we at vardan dental clinic do the root canal treatment as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="row">
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The Specialist takes an pretreatment X-Ray of the tooth for
          confirmation of diagnosis.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          For complete pain relief and for comfortable experience during
          treatment, local anesthesia is given before starting procedure. Our
          vardan dental team in Ahmedabad, using specially developed techniques
          and newer anesthetics drugs, ensures that you will not feel pain or
          any discomfort while administering local anesthesia. Thus, with
          effective anesthesia and efficient expert hands, this procedure
          becomes completely painless.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          After the tooth is anesthetized, root canal specialist uses a dental
          dam to fully isolate the tooth and maintain a sterile environment,
          increasing success rate of root canal treatment.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Access Opening of Tooth – Cleaning of the decay portion and making
          access to pulp tissue or root canal of tooth using modern high-speed
          hand pieces like DENTSPLY SIRONA (USA). It exposes the root canal and
          the damaged nerve and immediately resolves the pain of the tooth.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The root canal specialist measures length of all canals with J MORITA
          ROOT ZX II Apex Locator (a ROBOTIC digital equipment to judge the
          working length of root canal), which reduces requirements of multiple
          radiation exposures during treatment.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          BioMechanical Preparation of Root Canals – After measuring length, the
          Specialist cleans and reshapes the canal completely using NSK (UK)
          ENDOMATE DT (a ROBOTIC instrument for Root Canal Treatment), DENTSPLY
          PROTAPER ROTARY Flexi files with constant irrigation of canals with
          proper medicament. Achieving complete disinfection of root canals is
          the goal of this step.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Obturation – Once the tooth is made infection-free, the specialist
          obturates the canals with Gutta Percha filling material, seals the
          canals and take a final x-ray of confirmation.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          The residual crown portion is reinforced with the light cure
          composites.
        </li>
        <li class="col-md-12">
          Once the root canal treatment is completed, in many cases, the
          specialist will plan a crown or onlay on the tooth for long term
          function, aesthetics and protection.
